## Project Introduction

{% hint style="danger" %}
**UPDATE IN PROGRESS:** This new project guidebook will be a revised version of the [previous project guidebook](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/). Updates to this new guidebook will be occurring during summer 2019. All the page links \(assignments, etc.\) within this new guidebook should remain the same as the revised content is added.

{% tab title="➤ PROCESS" %}
In this project, students will collaborate in small teams to design, develop, and evaluate their own technology solutions to an authentic challenge. Teams will follow a user-centered design approach which focuses on understanding the goals, needs, expectations, and experiences of the people that will use their technology solution. Evaluation and testing of ideas and prototypes is integrated throughout the design and development process.

This project is designed to follow the research-based “Gold Standard” model of Project Based Learning \(PBL\) developed by the [Buck Institute of Education](http://www.bie.org/about/what_pbl).

This project is intended to be completed throughout a semester-long high school CS course. Here are the estimated times required to complete each project phase:

| **Project Phase** | **Estimated Time** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 Discover & Define Problem | 6-7 weeks |
| 2 Design & Build Solution | 6-7 weeks |
| 3 Evaluate & Refine Solution | 2 weeks |
| 4 Share Project with Public | 1 weeks |

#### Assignment Templates

Some of the project assignments include links to Google Drive templates \(document, spreadsheet, slide presentation, drawing, etc.\). All the templates are shared as "**View Only**." Students must create a **copy** of the template in order to modify it. \(Students should **not** request edit access, as the file is a master template for all students.\)

{% hint style="info" %}
**MAKE A COPY:**  To use a template, be sure you're logged in to your Google Account. From the template's **File** menu, select **Make a copy**. Save the copy to your shared team folder in Google Drive. You can now modify it.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="✓ OBJECTIVES" %}
This project reflects authentic principles and practices currently used in the technology industry. This project emphasizes design thinking, computational thinking, project management, and 21st century success skills \(such as creative thinking, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration\).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="★ GOING FURTHER" %}
It is recommended that each student also complete one or more [research reports](https://docs.idew.org/research-topics-in-computing/) in parallel to this project. These research reports should be shared with the class \(and beyond\).
