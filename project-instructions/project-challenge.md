Each team's video game must meet these design criteria:

* **Innovative:** your game is unique \(can be unique remix of existing game concepts\)
* **Engaging**: your game is fun and motivating to play \(based on targeted gaming motivations\)
* **Functional**: your game is functional and has no major problems \(e.g., no dead ends that prevent player from progressing, etc.\)
* **Usable**: your game provides clear feedback and is easy for new player to understand \(i.e., learning the game's controls, objectives, rules, etc.\)
* **Balanced**: your game mechanics are fine-tuned to produce desired gameplay \(e.g., balancing success vs. failure, risk vs. reward, skill vs. chance, etc.\)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="▲ CONSTRAINTS" %}
Each team's video game is subject to these constraints:

* Browser-based game created using Phaser CE
* 2D game world
* Single player game \(or multi-player game that uses single computer\)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="◼ TEAM ROLES" %}
Each team will have 2-4 members that serve in one or more of these roles:

* **Design Lead:** leads interaction design and evaluation of product
* **Development Lead:** leads building and programming of product
* **Business Lead:** leads business analysis and marketing of product
* **Project Manager:** leads team to ensure project completed successfully

**Teams of 2** need to designate one person as the Design Lead and the other person as the Development Lead. The Design Lead will also serve as the Business Lead, while the Development Lead will also serve as the Project Manager.

**Teams of 3** need to designate different people as the Design Lead, the Development Lead, and the Business Lead. One person will also need to serve as the Project Manager.

**Teams of 4** need to designate different people for each role.

It is highly recommended that each team agree to a set of team rules at the beginning of the project. Here is a possible [project team agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11OySnAbGoev728UWsiaUk818CputNZFJ291MJNwkRwc) that could be used.
