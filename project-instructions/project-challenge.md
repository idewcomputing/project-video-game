{% endtab %}

{% tab title="✓ DELIVERABLES" %}
Each phase of the project has a set of team deliverables, but they lead to these final deliverables from each team:

* **\(Product\)** that ...
* **Project Poster** that shows how your solution was created and highlights key features
* **Public Presentation** that demonstrates your solution and explains how it was created
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="★ CRITERIA" %}
Each team's video game must meet these design criteria:

* **Innovative:**  Your game should be unique \(can be unique remix of existing game concepts\).
* **Engaging**:  Your game should be fun and motivating to play \(i.e., match your targeted gaming motivations\).
* **Functional**:  Your game should be functional and have no major problems \(e.g., no dead ends that prevent player from progressing, etc.\).
* **Usable**:  Your game should provide clear feedback to players and be easy for a new player to learn \(e.g., learning game's controls, objectives, and rules\)
* **Balanced**:  Your game mechanics should be fine-tuned to produce desired gameplay \(e.g., balance success vs. failure, risk vs. reward, skill vs. chance, etc.\)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="▲ CONSTRAINTS" %}
Each team's video game is subject to these constraints:

* Browser-based game created using Phaser CE
* 2D game world
* Single player game \(or multi-player game that uses same computer – e.g., could be turn-based game, or players could use different input keys to play at same time\)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="◼ TEAM ROLES" %}
Each team will have 2-4 members that serve in one or more of these roles:

* **Design Lead:** leads interaction design and evaluation of product
* **Development Lead:** leads building and programming of product
* **Business Lead:** leads business analysis and marketing of product
* **Project Manager:** leads team to ensure project completed successfully

**Teams of 2** need to designate one person as the Design Lead and the other person as the Development Lead. The Design Lead will also serve as the Business Lead, while the Development Lead will also serve as the Project Manager.

**Teams of 3** need to designate different people as the Design Lead, the Development Lead, and the Business Lead. One person will also need to serve as the Project Manager.

**Teams of 4** need to designate different people for each role.

It is highly recommended that each team agree to a set of team rules at the beginning of the project. Here is a possible [project team agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11OySnAbGoev728UWsiaUk818CputNZFJ291MJNwkRwc) that could be used.
