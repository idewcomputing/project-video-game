# 3.1 Solution Evaluation

TK  - still in progress

{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
You'll have people outside your team playtest and evaluate your video game. External playtesting of a game is similar to [user testing](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/user-testing) of a website, app, or device. After the playtesting, each participant will complete a survey about your game.

Conducting this evaluation will help determine how well your game meets the project challenge criteria \(i.e., is your game innovative, engaging, functional, usable, and balanced\). Your team will use the evaluation data to identify issues with your game and make improvements before the public presentation.

1. **Prepare Survey**
   * Save a copy of [this survey form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fKrfaVmHQnGVecHKRbYR6FF-P9OitPnwEVA5tt05qPI) in your team's shared folder.
   * Open your saved copy of the survey, and modify the last question to list your game's targeted gaming motivations.
2. **Recruit Participants**
   * You'll need 3-5 participants to playtest your game in individual sessions.
   * Ideally, the participants should be similar to your target player persona — especially in terms of gaming motivations.
3. **Explain Playtesting Process**
   * Let the participant know the game is being tested, **not** the participant.
   * Let the participant know the game is a work-in-progress.
   * Ask the participant to “Think Aloud” while playing the game.
   * Do **NOT** explain your game because you need to observe first impressions.
4. **Observe Playtesting**
   * Allow the participant to play the game for about 5-10 minutes.
   * Record notes on issues you see or hear the participant experiencing.
   * If necessary, remind the participant to think aloud while playing.
5. **Ask Follow-Up Questions**
   * Afterwards, you can ask about specific issues you observed \(if you need to better understand why the issue occurred\).
6. **Administer Survey**
   * Open your saved survey, and click the Preview icon \(in upper right\) to allow the participant to take the survey.
7. Analyze Data

### ANALYZE SURVEY DATA

After all the playtesting sessions are completed, you’ll analyze the survey data.

Open the survey saved in your team’s Google Drive folder. At the top of the survey form, click on the "Responses" tab, which should default to showing the summary data from all submissions.

The summary will display a histogram \(similar to bar chart\) of the response distribution for each survey question:

* Responses categorized as 4 or 5 are **positive** because they indicate the participant either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement.
* Responses categorized as 3 are **neutral** because they indicate the participant neither agreed or disagreed with the statement.
* Responses categorized as 1 or 2 are **negative** because they indicate the participant either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement.

After each chart, you’ll see the written responses submitted by the participants to explain their ratings. You can compare these explanations against your team’s findings from your internal playtesting to see if the survey responses revealed any **new** issues that might need to be addressed. If so, add these new issues to your evaluation findings document.

**Create a summary document for each survey that shows the histogram charts \(in order\) of your team’s survey data.** If you hover over the upper right corner of a chart, you can click a copy icon, and then paste that chart into a document.

In the next assignment, you’ll use the evaluation findings to make refinements to your video game prototype before the public presentation event.
