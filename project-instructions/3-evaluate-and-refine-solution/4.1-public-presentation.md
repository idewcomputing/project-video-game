# 3.5 Public Presentation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will **explain and demonstrate your project solution to a public audience,** which might include professionals from industry, college, and your school – as well as parents and fellow students. Some audience members might be acting as judges reviewing the team projects. Many audience members may be learning about the project for the first time.

Your team's presentation needs to tell a complete story \(with a beginning, middle, and end\) in just a few minutes. The presentation should be clear, concise, engaging, and professional.

* Plan and practice your team’s presentation and demonstration
* When helpful, refer to your poster and product website during the presentation
* Be sure to allow the audience to examine and interact with your project solution
* Be prepared to answer questions from the audience
* Be prepared to adapt if a technical issue occurs during the demonstration
