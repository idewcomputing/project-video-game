{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Just as people like different types of books or movies, people like different types of video games. If you're going to design a video game, you'll need to know more about what motivates people to play certain games.

You'll start by taking a survey to determine your own Gamer Motivation Profile. Later in the project, your team will have to decide which gamer motivations to target for its game concept.

[Quantic Foundry](http://quanticfoundry.com/) is a game analytics consulting company that has gathered data from over 400,000 video game players to construct a scientific model that describes different types of gamer motivations.

This model identified 12 gaming motivations that form 6 groups. For example, _Challenge_ and _Strategy_ are motivations that belong to the _Mastery_ group.

1. [Take the online survey](https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/surveys/start/gamerprofile/) to determine your Gamer Motivation Profile. The survey takes about 10 minutes to complete.
2. Record your results in [this assignment document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QtWFyRvM4sgI5W1iHRpx-60IMaf7P4drH122iJjbMoc).
3. Discuss and compare your results with others in the class.
