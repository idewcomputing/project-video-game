Create a **slide presentation** that summarizes your team’s proposal for a video game. Practice your presentation before delivering it to your class.

Your team's presentation should include the following \(in this order\):

1. **Project Team:** game's working title, team name, team members & their roles
2. **Target Player Persona:** Describe the persona for your game, including the targeted gaming motivations and player experience goals.
3. **Premise:** Explain the game's premise, including its setting \(game world\), characters \(player and non-player\), and story \(if applicable\). Be sure to include concept sketches of the game world and characters.
4. **Objective:** Explain the objectives of the game, as well as the conflicts or challenges that players will face. If helpful, include concept sketches.
5. **Gameplay:** Explain how the basic gameplay will work and how it will progress from start to finish. If helpful, include concept sketches.

The presentation should have 5-12 slides and take about 5-10 minutes to deliver.
