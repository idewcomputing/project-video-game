{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Teams will code their video game based on their game design document.

A suggested order of what to code first will be provided. Emphasis will be on programming a minimal viable product \(MVP\) version of the game, rather than a full version. The game needs to be a playable demo that highlights the game design, but may not necessarily incorporate all envisioned features.

### **❏ Deliverables**

Submit the following:

* Pseudocode \(or flowchart\) for core gameplay
* JavaScript code \(`.js` file\) for the video game
