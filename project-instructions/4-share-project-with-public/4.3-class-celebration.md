{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
An important part of celebrating the completion of a project is expressing gratitude and appreciation towards people for their help and work on the project.

You'll create a list of people that you want to recognize:

* Thank people who provided help to you or your team
* Recognize exceptional work done by someone on your team or another team

Your list could include any people inside or outside the class that helped during the project. Be specific when describing the help or work done by the other person.

During your class celebration, share some of the recognitions publicly.

## **❏ Deliverable**
